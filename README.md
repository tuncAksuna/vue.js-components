# intro

> A basic Vue.js project

# AN OVERVÄ°EW OF THE APPLICATION
- The architecture of the application is quite understandable and extensible.
- App component is the main component that contains all components.
- In the architecture, data is sent from the main components to the child components. Sometimes the 'slot' structure is used for this process.
## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
